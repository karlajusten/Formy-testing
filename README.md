This project is based on ["Selenium Essential Training"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/selenium-essential-training/using-autocomplete?pathUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57f7e27c3dd559e018dfe994) course by Meaghan Lewis. In this course, Meaghan Lewis takes you past the basics covered in Learning Selenium, on to intermediate and advanced options. First, Meaghan reviews the fundamentals and shows you how to get the most out of WebDriver. Next, she takes you into the mechanics of advanced locators and interacting with components. Then she shares how to overcome common synchronization issues. She wraps up by covering workflows and integrations. 

I implemented the examples she shows in this project, the activities are involved in testinf the (Formy website)[https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/]. This project is I used java, maven, junit and cucumber. Cucumber is not used by Meaghan on the course. It's a personal choice, since I want also to learn cucumber.

To use cucumber, I started this project based on [Cucumber-Java Skeleton](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton).
